#In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x,y,z)

#You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

#Notice the space character after "Python " and "is ", without them the result would be "Pythonisawesome"
